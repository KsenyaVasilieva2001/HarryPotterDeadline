        <npctext>What a wonderful day! Today was probably the best Quidditch match in my life!</npctext>

    <node>
        <npctext>Well, it's sleepy time, I'm so exhausted... By the way, what day is today? </npctext>
    </node>
    <node>
        <npctext>Oh no! I have to bring the professor Snape my Potions homework!</npctext>
    </node>
    <node>
        <npctext>I totally forgot about it, I haven't done anything. Snape will kill me!</npctext>

    <node>
        <npctext>I still remember his words "Clearly, fame isn't everything... is it, Mr. Potter?"</npctext>

    <node>
        <npctext>My groupmates are sleeping, including Hermione. How do I do this task?</npctext>
    </node>
    <node>
        <npctext>All of I need is to make a potion. I need to find ingredients and get into potion class.</npctext>
    </node>
    <node>
        <npctext>But I need to watch out for Filch's Cat, she's on duty tonight.</npctext>
    </node>
    <node>
        <npctext>If she catches me for three times, I'll have to return to the hall.</npctext>
    </node>
    <node>
        <npctext>But I'm sure I can stop her with magic spell using my wand. But where is it?...</npctext>
    </node>
    <node>
        <npctext>Also I need force to use magic spell.</npctext>
    </node>
    <node>
        <npctext> I reckon I can do it!</npctext>
